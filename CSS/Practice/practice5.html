                <br/>
            <p>During the second part of the manga, Itachi becomes involved in Akatsuki's attacks on ninja possessing
                tailed-beast creatures until facing Sasuke in a one-on-one battle. Although Itachi perishes during the
                final duel, it is later revealed that he had been ordered by Konoha leadership to eliminate his clan to
                prevent a coup d'état, accepting the mission in exchange for Sasuke's safety. He is later resurrected
                during the Fourth Great Ninja War before his soul finally departs after helping to stop Kabuto Yakushi.
