            One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It
            follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, as he explores the Grand Line
            in search of the mythical treasure known as the "One Piece" to become the next King of the Pirates.

            The manga has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with
            its chapters compiled in 112 tankōbon volumes as of July 2025. It was licensed for an English language
            release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment.
            Becoming a media franchise, it has been adapted into a festival film by Production I.G, and an anime series
            by Toei Animation, which premiered in October 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed 14 animated feature
            films and one original video animation (OVA). Several companies have developed various types of
            merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and video games. Netflix released a live-action TV
            series adaptation in 2023.

            One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, expansive worldbuilding, art, characterization, and
            humor. It is regarded by critics and readers as one of the greatest manga series of all time. By August
            2022, it had over 516.6 million copies in circulation worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series
            ever and the best-selling comic series in volume format. It holds various publishing records, including the
            highest initial print run for any book in Japan. In 2015 and 2022, it set the Guinness World Records for
            "most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". It was the best-selling manga for
            11 consecutive years (2008–2018) and remains the only series with over 3 million initial prints for over ten
            years, as well as the only one with every of its over 100 published tankōbon volumes selling over 1 million
            copies. Since 2008, it has consistently ranked first in Oricon's weekly comic chart.
