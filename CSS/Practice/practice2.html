    <article id="art">Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the
        story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young, socially isolated ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of
        becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's
        pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot
        manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step
        Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).</article>
        <br/>

    <article id="art2">Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 1999
        to November 2014, with its 700 chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. Viz Media licensed the manga for North
        American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The manga was adapted
        into two anime television series by Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran from October 2002 to March 2017 on TV Tokyo.
        Pierrot also produced 11 animated films and 12 original video animations (OVAs). The franchise additionally
        includes light novels, video games, and trading cards. The story continues in Boruto, where Naruto's son Boruto
        Uzumaki creates his own ninja path as opposed to of following his father's.</article>

    <article id="art3">Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having 250 million copies in
        circulation worldwide. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of
        the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times's bestseller list several times, and the seventh
        volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Naruto has been praised for its character development, storylines, and action
        sequences, though some felt the latter slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which contains
        coming-of-age themes, often incorporates cultural references to Japanese mythology and Confucianism.</article>


    <p class="para">A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the
        Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, Minato
        Namikaze, at the cost of his life, seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making him
        a host of the beast.[i] The Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is
        often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage
        forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when
        Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to him. Naruto defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his
        teacher, Iruka Umino.[ii]

        Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and
        Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi
        Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers,
        ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.</p>

    <p class="para">After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam,
        enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams. During the
        exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the
        three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade, whom he chooses
        to become Fifth Hokage instead.

        During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic
        heritage, the Sharingan.[iii] After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi,[iv] who had
        shown up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill
        Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a group of ninja, including Naruto,
        to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up
        on Sasuke; Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he
        encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.</p>
